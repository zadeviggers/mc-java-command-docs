description: A system for customising all aspects of an item

<Badge text="Since 1.20.5" variant="tip" size="large" />

Item stack components are system for customising all aspects
of an item. It replaces the old NBT system for item customisation.

Content on this page is largely pulled from the official Minecraft patch notes, with light editing and formatting.

- Item types (e.g. `minecraft:stick`) hold a set of default components on an item that individual item stacks can override
- When advanced tooltips are enabled (F3+H), the number of components will be displayed instead of number of tags
- Default component values for items are now listed in `items.json` generated in `reports` directory
  - You can use [https://far.ddns.me/item](https://far.ddns.me/item) to look up the default components for items

## Item Syntax

- Components are specified after the item name in square brackets
  - Components are assigned with an `=` (e.g. `wooden_pickaxe[damage=23]`)
  - Components are comma-separated (e.g. `netherite_hoe[damage=5,repair_cost=2]`)
- Component types will be autocompleted, but possible values of them will not
- Values will however be validated, and the command will fail to parse if the component is improperly specified
  - e.g. `/give @s wooden_pickaxe[damage=-34]` is not valid
- The previous NBT syntax (`{...}`) has been removed, and replaced with `custom_data` assignment
  - e.g. `/give @s stick{foo:'bar'}` becomes `/give @s stick[custom_data={foo:'bar'}]`
- Many items have default implicit components. If you wish to remove these, add a bang (`!`) followed by the name of the component you wish to remove:
  - e.g. `/give @s minecraft:bread[!minecraft:consumable]` will give you bread lacking the [`minecraft:consumable` component](#minecraftconsumable), so it cannot be eaten

## Components on block entities

Non-default components on item stacks containing block items are now stored on block entities when placed.

- Component removals from defaults are currently not preserved
- Placing and breaking non-block entity blocks remains unchanged - nothing is preserved
- Does not automatically cause preserved components to be restored on drops - this requires addition of `copy_components` function to loot table
- Components are stored in field called `components`
  - Some components (like `custom_name`) are still handled by legacy serialization, which means they might not be present in there
  - Contains map of component id to component value

## Crafting

Most recipe types now accept `components` for the `result` item stack. This enables the long-requested 'NBT crafting'.

`components` is allowed on `result` for these recipe types:

- `crafting_shaped`
- `crafting_shapeless`
- `stonecutting`
- `smithing_transform`
- `smelting`
- `blasting`
- `smoking`
- `campfire_cooking`

When `crafting_transmute` is used, the item type changes but all item components are preserved.

Example: crafting an enchanted potato

```json
{
  "type": "minecraft:crafting_shapeless",
  "ingredients": ["minecraft:stick", "minecraft:cherry_sapling"],
  "result": {
    "id": "minecraft:poisonous_potato",
    "components": {
      "minecraft:enchantments": {
        "minecraft:knockback": 255
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Component types

### Entity variant components <Badge text="Since 1.22?" variant="caution" />

- Entities have a set of components for configuring variants and other aspects of appearance
- If those components are present on spawning item (like spawn eggs, mob buckets, `minecraft:painting`, `minecraft:item_frame`), they will be applied to new entity
- Mob buckets and paintings available in creative menu use variants instead of [`minecraft:entity_data` component](#minecraftentity_data)
- Custom tooltips for Bucket of Tropical Fish and Painting items are now based on new components instead of [`minecraft:bucket_entity_data`](#minecraftbucket_entity_data) and [`minecraft:entity_data`](#minecraftentity_data)

<Aside variant="caution">
  Components are currently not restored when spawn egg is picked from existing
  entity
