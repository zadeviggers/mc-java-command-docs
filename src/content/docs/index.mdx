<Aside>
  This is not an offical Minecraft Website. It is not approved by or associated
  with Mojang or Microsoft.

#### Currently covered topics:

- Item components
- Item models (WIP)

More content will be transcribed as systems are overhauled, or when I find time to trawl through old patch notes

#### Other notes

I do all of the transcription "manually" (i.e. heavy use of copy-paste & occasional scripting), no LLMs. I manually collate, format, and arrange the information from Mojang.

<Aside type="tip">
  These are *reference* docs, not teaching docs. To learn about how to make a datapack or resource package, see the Wiki pages:
  [datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) and [resource
  packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack).
