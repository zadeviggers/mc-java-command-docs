<Aside>
  This is not an offical Minecraft Website. It is not approved by or associated
  with Mojang or Microsoft.

#### Currently covered topics:

- [Item components](/items/item-components/)
- [Item models](/items/item-models/) (WIP: Not yet exhaustive)

More content will be transcribed as systems are overhauled, or when I find time to trawl through old patch notes

<Aside type="tip">
  These are *reference* docs, not teaching docs. To learn about how to make a datapack or resource package, see the Wiki pages:
  [datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) and [resource
  packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack).
