## RGB Colours

Minecraft has several ways of specifying colours. The [16 core colours](#16-core-colours) are often the easiest way, but usually only available for things colourable in normal gameplay. Most technical systems require the use of one of several RGB formats, such as [packed integers](#packed-integer-format), [percentage arrays](#array-format), or the well-known Hex Colours.

### Packed Integer format

<ColourConverter client:visible defaultOpen={false} />

Minecraft sometimes represents colors using a packed integer format, where an RGB color is stored as a single decimal integer. This is achieved by encoding the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) components into a 24-bit integer (`0xRRGGBB` in hex, or `(R << 16) | (G << 8) | B` in decimal).

Each color channel (Red, Green, and Blue) is an 8-bit value (0-255), which gets packed into a single integer using this formula:

```js
Packed_Integer = (R << 16) | (G << 8) | B;
// `<<` is a left shift and `|` is a bitwise OR
```

| Color Name | RGB (R, G, B) | Hex Code | Packed Integer |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Red        | (255, 0, 0)   | #FF0000  | 16711680       |
| Green      | (0, 255, 0)   | #00FF00  | 65280          |
| Blue       | (0, 0, 255)   | #0000FF  | 255            |
| Purple     | (255, 0, 255) | #FF00FF  | 16711935       |

### Array format

Things that use Minecraft's array RGB colour format takes a 3-item array of floating point numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Each of the three floats represents a percentage of Red, Green, and Blue respectively.

e.g.

```
[1.0, 0, 0.0] // Red
[0.475, 0.000, 0.631] // Purple
[0.427, 0.506, 0.588] // Slate grey
```

## 16 core colours

Commonly used in game for dyes and coloured blocks, these colours are supported in several technical areas, often where RGB colours aren't. Examples include [shields](../../items/item-components/#minecraftbase_color), [banners](../../items/item-models/#minecraftbanner), and text components.

- `orange`
